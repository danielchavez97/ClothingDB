#AWS EC2
Launched a medium instance ubuntu 18.04 LTS
set security groups to allow HTTP and HTTPS connections both inbound and outbound traffic
allow postgres TCP access inbound from my IP
saved the .pem file ClothDB.pem in local folder and used chmod 400 ClothDB.pem before SSH'ing into the server

#first step I installed postgres
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

#then make sure to open up ports/configure access to the database
#switch to postgres user
sudo su - postgres
#create user and give access (make superuser)
create user --interactive --pwprompt

createdb -O ClothDB danielchavez

#allow remote access

nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf 

change #listen_addresses = 'localhost' to listen_addresses = '*'

now go to nano /etc/postgresql/10/main/pg_hba.conf

change host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5 to host all all 0.0.0.0/0 md5

ctrl+d to exit postgres user 

then sudo systemctl restart postgresql

now you can connect from a remote machine (if its on the IP that the AWS security group allows)

with the URL: postgres://danielchavez:password@ec2ipaddress/ClothDB
